### Welcome to UniversalOS

This is a project created by Rocky43007 to build an OS which can run Linux, Windows and MacOS applications without having to switch oses or machines.

For the compiler used for this project, check out [this great tool by LordMilko](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools)!

**Note: This project is a work in progress as Rocky is learning how to build a kernel from scratch.**
