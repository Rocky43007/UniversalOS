### Welcome to UniversalOS

Tired of having to switch operating systems to run Mac applications, Windows or Linux specific applications? This operating system is for you! The goal of this project is to make a working operating system which can run these apps natively without having to reboot or run compatability layers such as WINE or WSL.

For the 32 bit and 64 bit compilers used for this project, check out [this great tool by LordMilko](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools)!

**Note: This project is a work in progress as Rocky is learning how to build a kernel from scratch.**
